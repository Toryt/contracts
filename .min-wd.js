/* Note: Firefox tests work up until version 58. After that, Selenium has a problem:
         POST /session/14641de4c7f12c2f9b2eaf307a0955edf23dc59b/timeouts/async_script did not match a known command
         No combination of browserstack.geckodriver and browserstack.selenium_version that worked was found.
         The solution is to call mochify with `--async-polling false`.

         This worked up until version 63.

         Since Safari 12 (the default on Mojave), we now get

         POST /wd/hub/session/37637d38c9bda442465f1e454894638aca029384/execute
         Unexpected HTTP status: 404 Not Found
         [â€¦]
         Response Message:
            POST /session/37637d38c9bda442465f1e454894638aca029384/execute did not match a known command

         We get the same problem with Firefox since Travis/654 d.d. 2018-12-29. Firefox 64 is being used since
         Travis/651 (and worked once without the problem).

         The logs say that both the last working and the first failing run use
         - browserstack.geckodriver: 0.21.0,
         - browserstack.selenium.jar.version: 3.11.0

         So, there was no switch there either.

/* NOTE:
    Safari eats stack traces in Web Driver mode (not when tested manually), and skips stack frames in general.
    Safari on iOS does very weird things with sometimes not setting a prototype property on new (non arrow) functions,
    or setting them 'late'. Some workarounds in tests are provided for this.

    Firefox only works with with `--async-polling false`.
    In general, runs on all browsers are more stable with `--async-polling false` (though a tad slower).

    Edge has trouble with the contract function name (test workaround)
