/**
 * Utility type to generate  the disjunction of all sub-tuples of a given tuple `T` that start `T`.
 *
 * This includes handling optional elements, ensuring that their inclusion and omission
 * are explicitly considered.
 *
 * ### How It Works
 * * **Base Case**: If `T` is an empty tuple (`[]`), the result is `[]`.
 * * **Recursive Case**:
 *   * Matches tuples with a definite last element (`[...start, last]`).
 *   * Matches tuples with an optional last element (`[...start, last?]`).
 *   * Includes the full tuple `T` and continues processing the starting sub-tuples (`start`).
 * * **Fallback**: If `T` doesnâ€™t match any of the patterns, resolves to `never`.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * type Example = [number, string, boolean]
 * type Subsets = StartingTuples<Example>
 * // Result: [number, string, boolean] | [number, string] | [number] | []
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // All starting tuples of [number, string?]
 * type Example1 = StartingTuples<[number, string?]>;
 * // Expected: [number, string?] | [number] | []
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript * // All starting tuples of [number, string, boolean?]
 * type Example2 = StartingTuples<[number, string, boolean?]>;
 * // Expected: [number, string, boolean?] | [number, string] | [number] | []
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript * // All starting tuples of an empty tuple
 * type Example4 = StartingTuples<[]>;
 * // Expected: []
 * ```
 *
 * @template T - The tuple to generate starting prefixes for.
