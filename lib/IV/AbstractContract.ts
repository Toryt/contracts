/**
 * Abstract definition of a function contract.
 *
 * An AbstractContract consists of an array of preconditions, an array of nominal postconditions,
 * and an array of exceptional postconditions.
 *
 * The conditions are functions whose result is interpreted as a booleany value.
 * The conditions are called with the same `this` and arguments as the functional call in which they are
 * verified. When verifying nominal postconditions, the result of the function call is added as extra argument.
 * When verifying exceptional postconditions, the exception thrown by the function call is added as extra argument.
 * Finally, a version of the contract function bound to `this` is supplied as final parameter when verifying
 * nominal and exceptional postconditions. This function reference can be used in contracts that use recursion.
 * `.outcome`, and `.callee` can be used to extract the result or exception (outcome) or bound function for recursive
 * definitions inside conditions from `arguments`.
 *
 * The default preconditions and postconditions are the empty array (anything goes). For exceptions, the default
 * condition is `AbstractContract.mustNotHappen` (any exception is a violation).
 *
 * Furthermore, an instance contains a `location` property, which is a line of text
 * that refers to the source code where the contract was created. For internal contracts, this is
 * `AbstractContract.internalLocation.
 *
 * If `verify` and `verifyPostconditions` are both truthy, contract function verification will verify preconditions,
 * postconditions and exception conditions. If `verify` is truthy, but `verifyPostconditions` is falsy, contract
 * function verification will verify preconditions, but not postconditions and exception conditions. This is the
 * default. If `verify` is falsy, contract function executions will not be verified.
 *
 * The `contract` of a contract function is a separate object that has the contract it is an implementation of as a
 * prototype. Therefor, the `verify` and `verifyPostconditions` properties can be overridden for all
 * `AbstractContracts` by changing the properties of `AbstractContracts.prototype`, for one contract by changing its
 * properties, or for a particular contract function `cf` by changing the properties of `cf.contract`. The values
 * the properties hold at the moment of the call are used (this is relevant for asynchronous functions).
 *
 * With well-tested code, the default settings should be used in production. When the code is extremely stable,
 * `verify` can be set to `false` to gain additional speed. In tests, `verify` should be truthy and
 * `verifyPostconditions` should be `true`, at least for the function under test.
 *
 * The `_location` argument is for internal use, and might be removed.
